# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Taylor! I am currently a Masters Student at The Bren School of Environmental Science & Management.

## About me

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a bioeconomic evaluation of Distant Water Fishing strategies in Liberia for Conservation International, assessing economic and environmental trade-offs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced R programming, species distribution modeling, and climate scenario analysis.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects at the intersection of finance, conservation, and climate resilience, especially involving nature markets or the blue economy
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: tcook.f13@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: My work has ranged from spatial analysis of indicator species on Californiaâ€™s sandy beaches to reducing nutrient pollution in Mauiâ€™s coral reefs â€” and now, to developing conservation finance mechanisms that move capital into nature-positive solutions, all in support of a more sustainable blue economy.
